# CityLights

### Introduction
An interactive digital art project created using Proccessing with Java. 
Emulates city lights painting the night sky and water. 

### Details
When the program is first opened, it is nothing but a dark starry night. The two red dots blinking next to the stars are metaphors for the aviation lights on top of tall buildings. The middle section of the canvas are filled with windows of buildings. While moving your cursor, if it touches a window, it will light up. Instead of drawing literal buildings, I wanted to make up the building with lit up windows because at night, that is all you can see. As more windows light up, the bottom section, which represents the river, begins to sparkle from the reflected light of the buildings.
